# Language Toolkit

The name for this project comes from "Fully Automated Luxury Boltzmann
Sampling", which was the code that started this off: It takes a regular
expression and builds a family of Boltzmann samplers for it.

It's since become more general and is basically my dumping ground for
interesting code around manipulating formal languages.

It's all a bit experimental and should not be considered production ready.
It basically works, but it's not especially good code.
